## 🎯 What’s Different This Time?

- ✅ No tutorials
- ✅ No YouTube videos
- ✅ Only Google, MDN Docs & ChatGPT (no code copy-paste)
- ✅ Daily GitHub pushes
- ✅ Building in public

> ⚠️ **Note:** The focus is only on JavaScript logic — not on fancy UI.  
> Most UIs are kept minimal or rough to save time & stay logic-focused.

## 📌 Why I’m Doing This

- To test what I’ve *actually* learned
- To get better at debugging + thinking through logic
- To write clean, working code without relying on tutorials
- To track progress publicly and stay consistent
